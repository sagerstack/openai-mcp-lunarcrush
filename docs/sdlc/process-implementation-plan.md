# Implementation Plan Management

Guidelines for managing implementation plans in markdown files to track progress on completing a user story.
Adopt the best coding practices when implementing each task

## File Location
- **Location:** typically same folder as user story
- **Filename pattern:** `impl-plan-[user-story-id].md`
- **Section** Locate the Task-Based Implementation Plan section in the implementation plan

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say “yes” or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- If a parent-task or sub-task is marked as `[MANUAL]`, stop and ask user to implement it, and mark `[x]` after completion. Once this is done, continue implementation from the next task.

## Implementation Plan Maintenance

1. **Update the implementation plan as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with implementation plans, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the implementation plan file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
